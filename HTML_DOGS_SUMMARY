        <p style="font-family: Arial">During the ice age, gray wolves were animals that could be found nearly everywhere, and for a good reason too. They were built to kill,with their powerful jaws were great at ripping apart flesh, their powerful hind legs allowed them to move incredibly fast, and because they traveled in packs, they typically had an advantage against their prey. However, humans were also quite dominant at this time. And they were adept hunters as well, so adept that they ended up with a surplus of meat that they couldn't eat alone. This is because most of the meat that was available to humans was full of more protein than they could handle! But wolves could easily handle the extra protein, and given that wolves were competing against humans for food, when they could work together, there was almost no other solution. By domesticating wolves, not only did humans have use for their extra meat, but they could also hunt more efficiently! But <em>why</em> are there so many breeds of dogs? Well...

      <h3 style="font-family: Arial">Selective breeding</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">So how DID we go from one or two kinds of wolf to the hundreds of breeds of dogs we have today? Well this was no accident, we did this on purpose! This was done through <strong>selective breeding</strong>. Selective breeding is the act of breeding two kinds of animals or plants, or two kinds of the same species, in order to get a child with the characteristics that you want! You can remove or add genes through selective breeding so that you can have a dog with the desired characteristics. Think of it like you're building a dog out of lego. If you wanted, you could make it faster by giving it bigger hind legs, you could take away some pieces to make the legs shorter, you could even do something as simple as making the ears flop over! The advantages of selective breeding include breeding dogs that are more fit for a certain job, like corgis were bred to herd sheep. Golden retrievers and labrador retrievers were bred to help people when hunting. Some people breed dogs that they just think will look cute!

    <h2 style="font-family: Arial">What kinds of dogs are there?</h2>
      <h3 style="font-family: Arial">The most popular dog breeds!</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">Here are the top 5 most popular dog breeds this year!</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial"><mark>1. The Labrador Retriever:</mark> This dog has been the most popular breed in the U.S. for 20 years in a row, and its no surprise why. It's so easily recognizable, it's gentle nature makes it great with kids, and it even makes a good working dog!</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial"><mark>2. The French Bulldog:</mark> This Dog breed has been climbing up the ranks in terms of pupularity over the last few years! They are quite small and don't need too much exercise, although they do often have a few health issues, much like the pug due to their small stubby snouts.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial"><mark>3. The German Shepherd:</mark> This dog is an amazing working dog, and excels at everything from guide dog to police dog. German shepherds also tend to live a bit longer than the two previously mentioned breeds, and are great with families, but they do need quite a bit of exercise.</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial"><mark>4. The Golden Retriever:</mark> This dog has consistently been ranked as one of the most popular dog breeds, for a number of reasons. To list a few, they are loyal, generally cheerful, and even work quite well!</p>
  <p style="font-family: Arial"><mark>5. The Bulldog:</mark> Don't confuse this breed with the french bulldog! The bulldog is bigger than the french bulldog, dogs are cool but that  mean it requires a bit more excersise, but they still love to snuggle with their owners just as much as any other breed! Although they have similar health issues to the french bulldog. Sources: <a href=https://petkeen.com/most-popular-dog-breeds/>Petkeen</a></p>

      <center><h3 style="font-family: Arial" >The differences between breeds</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">So what makes these dogs different? Well, aside from the obvious things like looks, there are a lot of differences between dog breeds! I already went over this in the "selective breeding" paragraph, but different dogs have been bread  to do different things. For example, due to the German Shepherds intelligence paired with their loyalty, they are prime candidates to be working dogs! Different breeds have different advantages, some work well with families like the beagle, while others don't need a lot of excersise like the french bulldog, border collies are great companions, others just look cute! I won't linger on this topic too long, but each dog breed is completely  unique!</p>

    <h2 style="font-family: Arial">What are some practical uses for dogs?</h2>
       <h3 style="font-family: Arial">Working dogs</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">Dogs don't only make great companions, they can be really helpful as well! In fact, dogs were originally domesticated to help people with their day to day lives. A few key examples of working dogs are Guide dogs, Emotional support dogs, and Herding Dogs.</p>
   <p style="font-family: Arial"><strong class="WorkingDog">Guide Dogs:</strong>Guide dogs, sometimes called "Seeing Eye Dogs", help blind people move around more efficiently. Guide dogs, are not pets. Unlike pets, which are typically banned in places like restaraunts, and can't go on airplanes with you, guide dogs  are allowed in places where pets typically are not. This is because the dogs owner relies on the dog to help them move around! Not all blind people have the luxury of using guide dogs, wether this is because of an allergy, or because of some other reason. In fact, only around 2% of blind people use guide dogs! Unlike pets, Guide Dogs usually aren't allowed to interact with other dogs when they are working. However, Guide dogs typically are trained to recognize when they are working or not by whether or not they are wearing their harness, meaning that if the guide dog isn't wearing a harness, you can ask the owner if you can pet it!Sources: <a href=https://www.guidingeyes.org/about/faqs/>Guiding Eyes For The Blind</a></p>

  <p style="font-family: Arial"><strong class="WorkingDog">Emotional Support dogs:</strong> While owning a pet dog can increase your mental health, some people need the presence of a dog to  properly function! An emotional support animal has to be prescribed by a doctor. Emotional support dogs dcan be of any breed, unlike guide dogs, which are typically larger dogs. Emotional support dogs help people who suffer from anexiety, depression, and an array of other mental illnesess. Emotional support dogs, just like Guide Dogs are allowed on flights as of 2020.

  <p style="font-family: Arial"><strong class="WorkingDog">Herding Dogs:</strong> Herding dogs are extremely energetic and great with families, but as their name implies, they can also help with herding livestock! The use of herding dogs can be tracked all the way back to the 1570s where they were used to help shepherds herd sheep. How DO herding dogs help move the livestock? Well different breeds do it in different ways. Some will bark, others will nip at the heels of the livestock, others will merely stare at the livestock. Some dogs that are classified as herding dogs, are quite surprising. Here's two of my personal favorites. The Welsh Corgie. With their short legs and their large ears, and overall goofy appearance, it was quite surprising to me when I found out that they were herding dogs! Another odd herding dog is the Puli. To be perfectly honest, this dog looks like a mop. It would probably fit right in with the sheep if it had a white coat.

       <h3 style="font-family: Arial">Training the dogs</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">Most dogs aren't born with the ability to be competent working dogs, so how do they learn to do their jobs? Well some dogs are bred to have the instinctual desire to help in certain ways like herding dogs, but some kinds of jobs, dogs have to be trained for, such as Police dogs and Guide dogs, but the example I'll be going over is Police dogs. Police dogs are mainly German Shepherds  and Belgian Malinois, but technically they can be whatever breed the officer chooses, although I doubt you will see a police officer walking around with a chihuahua! But let's Talk about the training. Training a police dog takes far longer than training dogs for most other jobs, and it doesn't even end once the dog is done training, maintnence is regularly performed on a dog that has completed training. The dogs will not only be trained with the goal of heightening their physical and mental capabilities, but they will also be trained to form a strong bond with the officer they will be paired with.

    <h2 style="font-family: Arial">Should I get a dog?</h2>

  <p style="font-family: Arial">Well after all this talk about dogs, you might be wondering if <em><strong>you</strong></em> should get a dog. But to that I say, do you WANT a dog? Does a dog make sense in your home? Are you allergic? Does your aprtment complex/landlord allow dogs? All these factors need to be considered before getting a dog. And not only that, but you need to take care of it, play with it, feed it, and give it water. If you want a dog, but can't support it for one reason or another, It would probably be in your best interest to refrain from getting a dog for the time being. And like <cite>HomesAlive.ca</cite> says,<q>Breed matters.</q> And this leads me to my next point.</p>
      <h3 style="font-family: Arial">Which kind of dog is right for you?</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial">If you are able to support a dog and you want a dog, then great! But, there is one more hurdle to overome befor getting a dog. Deciding the breed. Different breeds work well in different households, and some might be better for you than others. If you are able to exercise your dog often, then a more energetic breed might be a good pick for you. Some examples are poodles, German shepherds(I'm biased), or a retriever.     
  Some dogs are great with families. These breeds include a few collies, St Bernards, and Great Danes. Some dogs work well in small households. Some of these dogs are, Greyhounds, Pugs, and Bulldogs! If you have a larger living space then you could probably consider whatever breeds you want if you can give the dog enough exercise! Speaking of giving the dog enough excersize, I feel as though that is one the most important factors to consider when getting a dog, which is why I have this chart with some of the most popular dog breeds and how much excersise they need.</p>
